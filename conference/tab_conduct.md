# Code of Conduct

We want to make the OWASP NZ Day a welcoming environment for all attendees. To that end, we would like to remind you that all activities associated with this event are subject to OWASP's [Conference & Event Attendee](/www-policy/operational/conferences-events.html) Policies. At their core, these policies are intended to promote and maintain an inclusive, welcoming environment for all participants - actions detrimental to that environment are unwelcome.

Speakers, trainers and sponsors have all been reminded of these policies, and are expected to abide by them like all attendees.

If you have any concerns during the day, please seek out John, Judy, or James. We will make ourselves visible at the start of the day, so you know what we look like. 

Conference committee members will be wearing distinctive blue t-shirts. Please feel free to approach any committee member, or stop by one of the Conference Information desks, if you encounter any issue.
