**The New Top 10 Web AppSecurity Risks**     
**Abstract:** 

All web app developers should know the OWASP Top 10 â€“ a list of the biggest cybersecurity concerns that commonly appear in web applications.

Every few years, the list is updated based on feedback from the community, observations in the wild, and changes to the threat landscape.

The list was recently updated, and in this talk, Kevin will run us through those changes and help us to build (or break) modern web applications.

### Call For Speakers

Our Call For Speakers is always open. If you would like to present a talk relevant to Application Security at a future OWASP New Zealand Chapter Meetup, review the [speaker agreement](/www-policy/speaker-agreement) and send your proposed talk title, abstract, and a brief speaker bio to the Chapter Leader(s) in the city(ies) where you'd like to present.

### Call for Organisers

OWASP New Zealand currently has active Meetups in three cities - Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington. If you're interested in helping organise one of our Meetups, please contact the Chapter Leader in that city.

If you are located in another New Zealand city, and would be willing and able to host a Meetup there (at least four times per year), then we'd love to hear from you.

### The OWASP New Zealand Board

We are always looking for additional board members to evangelise OWASP and its mission, and to help with meetings, projects, and initiatives. As we all know, it takes lots of time and effort to run a chapter. Please contact us if you are interested in joining the OWASP New Zealand board, would like to volunteer to help out or create a new Meetup/event, or for any queries related to the OWASP New Zealand Chapter.
