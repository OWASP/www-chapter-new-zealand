## OWASP New Zealand

Welcome to the OWASP New Zealand Chapter home page.

The OWASP New Zealand Chapter has been active since 2007. In addition to supporting and participating in the annual [AppSec New Zealand Conference](https://appsec.org.nz/conference), we organise local Meetups and training events throughout the year.

The primary Meetup leaders are [Austin Chamberlain](mailto:austin.chamberlain@owasp.org) (Auckland), [Pete Nicholls](mailto:pete.nicholls@owasp.org) (Christchurch), [John DiLeo](mailto:john.dileo@owasp.org) (Hamilton), and [Matt Cotterell](mailto:matt.cotterell@owasp.org) (Wellington).

### State of AppSec in New Zealand - 2022

In early 2022, a group of volunteers created the inaugural **State of AppSec in New Zealand Survey**, to gain first-hand information from 
New Zealand organisations that develop and/or use software (i.e., all of them), regarding how they manage, fund, and prioritise the security of the
applications they build and use.

### Call For Speakers

Our Call For Speakers is always open. If you would like to present a talk relevant to Application Security at a future OWASP New Zealand Chapter Meetup, review the [speaker agreement](/www-policy/speaker-agreement) and send your proposed talk title, abstract, and a brief speaker bio to the Chapter Leader(s) in the city(ies) where you'd like to present.

### Call for Organisers

OWASP New Zealand currently has active Meetups in three cities - Auckland, Hamilton, and Christchurch. If you're interested in helping organise one of our Meetups, please contact the Chapter Leader in that city.

If you are located in another New Zealand city (especially Wellington), and would be willing and able to host a Meetup there (at least four times per year), then we'd love to hear from you.

### The OWASP New Zealand Board

We are always looking for additional board members to evangelise OWASP and its mission, and to help with meetings, projects, and initiatives. As we all know, it takes lots of time and effort to run a chapter. Please contact us if you are interested in joining the OWASP New Zealand board, would like to volunteer to help out or create a new Meetup/event, or for any queries related to the OWASP New Zealand Chapter.
